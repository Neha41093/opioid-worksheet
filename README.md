## To-do

- [X] Make "approach" dependent upon surgery type in form

## Potential Extensions
- Include separately or in the same design the Physical Therapy illustrations.
    - This would require creating a bank of images.
- Often discharge sheets come with the exercises related to Physical Therapy. To include this, illlustrations, or similar visuals should be developed from a bank to be included in one of the available spaces of the Discharge Worksheet we are proposing.
